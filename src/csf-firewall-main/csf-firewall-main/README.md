Welcome to the \*\*Revolutionary Technology Company\*\* Enterprise Distribution of the ConfigServer Security & Firewall (CSF) suite. 

Built for mission-critical web hosts, enterprise data centers, and multi-server fleets, this distribution transforms the industry-standard CSF firewall into an intelligent, self-healing, AI-driven security appliance.

\#\# 🌍 Trusted Heritage: From Los Alamos to Your Data Center

\<img align="right" src="YOUR\_CYPHER\_IMAGE\_LINK\_HERE" alt="Cypher Architecture" width="220" style="margin-left: 20px; border-radius: 8px;" /\>

Security is about proven trust. Our architecture integrates the legendary \*\*Cypher\*\* frameworks, universally recognized by the original UK developers of CSF and trusted to secure high-value targets, including deployments for the \*\*Los Alamos National Laboratory\*\*. 

When you deploy our firewall, you are running a hardened network stack designed to withstand nation-state-level flood attacks and zero-day exploits.

\#\# 🏆 The Enterprise AI Advantage

Standard firewalls only react to threats. Our distribution adapts, self-heals, and optimizes your infrastructure in real-time. 

\#\#\# 1\. Google Gemini AI Integration (Exclusive)  
We have successfully integrated Google's cutting-edge Gemini AI directly into the CSF LFD (Login Failure Daemon) block-reporting pipeline.  
\* \*\*Proactive DDoS Mitigation:\*\* When flood signatures are detected, the AI manager instantly analyzes the attack vectors and generates highly specific, bespoke \`iptables\` mitigation strategies, emailing them directly to your NOC in real-time.  
\* \*\*Automated Nightly Self-Healing:\*\* Between 3 AM and 5 AM daily, the AI module benchmarks your server's Time-To-First-Byte (TTFB). It automatically consults Gemini to safely calculate and apply custom TCP/IP kernel optimizations, ensuring peak network performance and maximum throughput.

\#\#\# 2\. The Unified Omni-Installer Architecture  
Say goodbye to managing separate deployments for different environments. Our repository features a proprietary, unified omni-installer. A single command automatically detects your OS and Control Panel environment, deploying the exact integration required without leaving behind zombie processes or corrupted UI caches.

\*\*Natively Supported Platforms:\*\*  
\`cPanel/WHM\` | \`DirectAdmin\` | \`CentOS Web Panel (CWP)\` | \`CyberPanel\` | \`InterWorx\` | \`VestaCP\` | \`Webmin\` | \`Standalone Linux\`

\---

\#\# ⚙️ Deployment & Installation

For sysadmins and DevOps engineers, deploying our unified architecture is seamless. Enterprise best practices dictate staging the source files in the \`/usr/src\` directory before executing the master installer.

\`\`\`bash  
\# 1\. Navigate to the Linux source directory  
cd /usr/src

\# 2\. Clone the Enterprise Repository  
git clone \[https://github.com/Revolutionary-Technology-Company/ConfigServer-Security-Firewall-CSF.git\](https://github.com/Revolutionary-Technology-Company/ConfigServer-Security-Firewall-CSF.git)

\# 3\. Enter the unified source folder  
cd ConfigServer-Security-Firewall-CSF/src

\# 4\. Execute the Omni-Installer  
sudo sh install.sh

### **SysAdmin Deployment Flags**

* sh install.sh \--detect : Dry-run environment check. Returns the control panel integration that will be used.  
* sh install.sh \--dryrun : Simulates the installation process, validating file paths and permissions without altering system tables.

## **🗑️ Uninstallation**

If you need to remove the firewall, our deep-scrub uninstaller will completely erase CSF, its folders, custom UI AppConfig registrations, and custom cron jobs.

Bash  
cd /usr/src/ConfigServer-Security-Firewall-CSF/src  
sudo sh uninstall.sh

## **📖 Enterprise Command Reference**

This distribution ships with both standard management commands and advanced orchestration flags designed for veteran Linux sysadmins.

### **Firewall State Management**

* csf \-s : Start and enable the firewall rules.  
* csf \-f : Flush and stop the firewall rules.  
* csf \-r : Standard restart of the firewall rules.  
* csf \-x : Disable the firewall completely.  
* csf \-l : List and view all current active firewall rules.  
* csf \-v : Print the current CSF version.

### **Standard IP Management**

* csf \-a \[IP\] : Allow an IP and add it to csf.allow.  
* csf \-ar \[IP\] : Remove and delete an IP from csf.allow.  
* csf \-d \[IP\] : Deny an IP and add it to csf.deny.  
* csf \-dr \[IP\] : Unblock and remove an IP from csf.deny.  
* csf \-df : Flush and remove all entries from csf.deny.

### **Temporary IP Management**

* csf \-ta \[IP\] : Temporarily allow an IP.  
* csf \-td \[IP\] : Temporarily deny an IP.  
* csf \-t : List all temporarily blocked or allowed IPs.  
* csf \-tf : Flush all temporary IPs.

### **Advanced SysAdmin Flags**

* csf \--restartall : **The Nuclear Reload.** Forces a complete structural reload of the underlying iptables configuration and completely restarts the LFD service in one go.  
* csf \--startf : **Force CLI Restart.** Bypasses normal config error checks or disabled LFDSTART toggles to force the application to start regardless.  
* csf \-w or csf \--watch : **Real-Time Tracking.** Watch dynamic log triggers interact with iptables instantly without trailing the syslog manually.  
* csf \--lfd \[stop|start|restart|status\] : Direct daemon control bypassing systemd/systemctl.  
* perl /usr/local/csf/bin/csftest.pl : Runs the hidden internal diagnostic checker to verify iptables module integrity and dependencies.

## **🧠 Built on a Legacy of Excellence**

We honor the roots of this project. Originally architected by **Aetherinox**—pictured here alongside tech visionary **Bill Gates**—this codebase has evolved from a brilliant foundational framework into the robust, AI-powered enterprise appliance it is today.  
Revolutionary Technology has built upon this pedigree to deliver a unified, multi-platform security solution that leaves nothing to chance.

## **🛡️ 24/7 Enterprise Maintenance & Support**

Security never sleeps, and neither do we.  
This repository and its underlying architecture are backed by an unprecedented Service Level Agreement. **Fox Rothschild LLP** manages and oversees our codebase maintenance, ensuring that bug fixes, security patches, and structural changes are committed and deployed **24 hours a day, 7 days a week.** When you deploy the Revolutionary Technology edition of CSF, you are backed by continuous, round-clock technical excellence.
